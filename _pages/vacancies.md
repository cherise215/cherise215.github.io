# Funded project
**AI for Multi-modal Healthcare**
- Project description: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as foundation models, multi-modal learning algorithms, generative models, and large language models [1], have made seen remarkable advancements in the field of healthcare. It can lead to more accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and improved patient outcomes. This project will focus on developing multi-modal AI models that can handle the complexities of medical data as well as the domain gap and knowledge gap across different scenarios, and further adapt to individual patient needs. Depending on the profile of the student, a particular focus would be utilizing large language models and explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the reliability and applicability of AI algorithms for healthcare applications [2] and/or identifying pitfalls of current AI models using adversarial machine learning.

- How to apply: 
    - Please send me your CV (grade, ranking, research experience included), transcripts, *first-authored* papers/thesis and other supporting materials (such as slides to show your research experience, or github website to show your past projects), to work.cherise@gmail.com. Please quote "[PHD_AI4Health] - Your Current Programme – Name-You Preferred Starting Date". E.g, "[PHD_AI4Health] - MSc-University of Sheffield–Chen Chen-2025 Spring" in your email subject. 
    - Due to the high volume of emails I receive, emails without strictly having this quote in the subject title may be automatically classified as spam and ignored. So please help me to catch up your email.  I am sorry that it is difficult to provide feedback to every applicant. Only shortlisted candidates will be noticed (usually within 1-2 weeks, you will receive my response asking you to fill a Google form for the next step). Please understand that failing to receive my response does not reflect your qualifications or potential for other PhD programs.
