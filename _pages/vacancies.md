**PhD in Robust and Adaptive AI for Medical Imaging and Precision Medicine**

A 3.5-year funded PhD studentship is available in the Department of Computer Science at University of Sheffield, working on the topic of robust and adaptive AI-enabled vision system for medical imaging and precision medicine.

**About the project**

The field of medical imaging and precision medicine has seen remarkable advancements in recent years, driven by the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as transformers, powerful foundation models, multi-modal learning algorithms, and large language models [1]. These technologies can revolutionize healthcare by enabling accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and improved patient outcomes. This project will focus on developing robust and adaptive AI models that can handle the complexities of medical imaging data as well as the domain gap and knowledge gap across different scenarios, and further adapt to individual patient needs. Depending on the profile of the student, a particular focus would be identifying pitfalls of current AI models with adversarial machine learning techniques and/or explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the reliability and applicability of AI algorithms for healthcare applications.

The starting date for this position is negotiable, preferred to be in Sep. 2024.
