**We have vacancies for both new PhD and visiting students at Sheffield.**

University of Sheffield is ranked as *5th* in the UK, *17th* in Europe for research in relevant AI/CV/NLP/ML/Complexity areas [CSRanking](https://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&act&uk).

# Funded project
**AI for Multi-modal Healthcare**
- Project description: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as foundation models, multi-modal learning algorithms, generative models, and large language models [1], have made seen remarkable advancements in the field of healthcare. It can lead to more accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and improved patient outcomes. This project will focus on developing multi-modal AI models that can handle the complexities of medical data as well as the domain gap and knowledge gap across different scenarios, and further adapt to individual patient needs. Depending on the profile of the student, a particular focus would be utilizing large language models and explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the reliability and applicability of AI algorithms for healthcare applications [2] and/or identifying pitfalls of current AI models using adversarial machine learning.
