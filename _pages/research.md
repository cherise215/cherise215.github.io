Research Interest
-----------------
My main research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare with a particular focus on medical image and signal analysis, e.g., medical image segmentation, focusing on building and verifying robust, data-efficient, reliable machine learning algorithms to scale up AI-powered medical image and signal analysis in real-world applications. Below are some topics I have explored:

* Multi-modal learning for healthcare, incl. image, signal, and texts (medical report) using large language models
* Robust machine learning
* Explainable machine learning
* Advanced data augmentation incl. adversarial data augmentation and generative models
* Data-efficient learning: self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, semi-supervised learning
* Multi-task learning
* Adaptive machine learning, including unsupervised domain adaptation at training/test time
* Algorithms with fairness, privacy, robustness, and interpretability in mind, including uncertainty-aware training, test time model calibration

I am extremely interested in their applications including:

* cardiac image analysis (segmentation, registration, and shape remodeling) with quality control (e.g. topology preserving, uncertainty measurement), follow-up motion/shape analysis, survival prediction, treatment planning
* Other medical image analysis inlc. prostate image analysis together with pathological image analysis, risk prediction, treatment planning; brain image segmentation and surface reconstruction for clinical applications.
* Signal processing and analysis, incl. ECG signal
