Dr Chen (Cherise) Chen is a Lecturer in Computer Vision, at the Department of Computer Science, [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), a core member of [Insigeno Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/insigneo) and [Shef.AI](https://shef-ai.github.io/) community. She also currently holds honorary research fellow positions at both the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. Previously, she was a post-doc at [Oxford BioMedIA](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/#ourresearch) group, University of Oxford, and the Computing Department at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (ICL). She was also a research scientist at [HeartFlow](https://www.heartflow.com/). In 2022, she obtained her Ph.D. from the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, working closely with [Prof. Daniel Rueckert ](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.rueckert)and [Dr. Wenjia Bai](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.bai). Her doctoral thesis, entitled "Improving the domain generalization and robustness of neural networks for medical imaging," was featured in ComputerVisionNews magazine in 2022.

Research Interest
-----------------

My main research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare with a particular focus on medical image analysis, e.g., medical image segmentation, focusing on building and verifying robust, data-efficient, reliable machine learning algorithms to scale up AI-powered medical image analysis in real-world applications. Below are some topics I have explored:

* Adversarial data augmentation
* Robust machine learning
* Data-efficient learning: self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, semi-supervised learning
* Multi-task and multi-modal learning
* Adaptive machine learning, including unsupervised domain adaptation at training/test time
* Algorithms with fairness, privacy, robustness, and interpretability in mind, including uncertainty-aware training, test time model calibration

I am extremely interested in their applications including:

* cardiac image analysis (segmentation, registration, and shape remodeling) with quality control (e.g. topology preserving, uncertainty measurement), follow-up motion/shape analysis, survival prediction, treatment planning
* prostate image analysis together with pathological image analysis, risk prediction, treatment planning
* brain image segmentation and surface reconstruction for clinical applications.
