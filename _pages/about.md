Dr Chen (Cherise) Chen is a Lecturer in Computer Vision, at the Department of Computer Science, [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), and a core member of [Insigeno Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/insigneo), [Center for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence), and [Shef.AI](https://shef-ai.github.io/) community. She is one of six academics leading the [Computer Vision research group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/computer-vision) at Sheffield. She also currently holds honorary research fellow positions at both the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. Previously, she was a post-doc at [Oxford BioMedIA](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/#ourresearch) group, University of Oxford, and the Computing Department at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (ICL). She was also a research scientist at [HeartFlow](https://www.heartflow.com/). In 2022, she obtained her Ph.D. from the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, working closely with [Prof. Daniel Rueckert ](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.rueckert)and [Dr. Wenjia Bai](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.bai). Her doctoral thesis, entitled "Improving the domain generalization and robustness of neural networks for medical imaging," was featured in ComputerVisionNews magazine in 2022.

Research Interest
-----------------

My main research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare with a particular focus on medical image and signal analysis, e.g., medical image segmentation, focusing on building and verifying robust, data-efficient, reliable machine learning algorithms to scale up AI-powered medical image and signal analysis in real-world applications. Below are some topics I have explored:

* Multi-modal learning for healthcare, incl. image, signal, and texts (medical report)
* Robust machine learning
* Explainable machine learning
* Advanced data augmentation incl. adversarial data augmentation and generative models
* Data-efficient learning: self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, semi-supervised learning
* Multi-task and multi-modal learning
* Adaptive machine learning, including unsupervised domain adaptation at training/test time
* Algorithms with fairness, privacy, robustness, and interpretability in mind, including uncertainty-aware training, test time model calibration

I am extremely interested in their applications including:

* cardiac image analysis (segmentation, registration, and shape remodeling) with quality control (e.g. topology preserving, uncertainty measurement), follow-up motion/shape analysis, survival prediction, treatment planning
* Other medical image analysis inlc. prostate image analysis together with pathological image analysis, risk prediction, treatment planning; brain image segmentation and surface reconstruction for clinical applications.
* Signal processing and analysis, incl. ECG signal
