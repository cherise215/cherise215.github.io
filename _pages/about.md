I am a Lecturer in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Imperial-X, Imperial College London. Previously, I was a Lecturer at School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh from July 2020 to September 2022. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computing Research from Imperial College London in January 2020, and M.Sc. in Control Science and Engineering from Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in July 2015. Before moving to University of Edinburgh, I have worked as a post-doctoral research associate at Department of Computing, Imperial College London, where I have worked on deep learning-based MRI reconstruction, image registration and segmentation. Our pioneering work on convolutional recurrent neural networks for MRI reconstruction has been highly and widely recognised by international leading groups from both academia and industry. Overall, we have published more than 40 papers in top-tier peer-reviewed engineering and medical imaging journals and conference proceedings ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=mTWrOqHOqjoC&alert_preview_top_rm=2)). I have also served as an area chair for MICCAI 2022 and a member of organising and programme committee at several international workshops, e.g., CMRxMotion 2022 and MLMIR 2022.

Research Interest
======
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Medical Image Analysis, Computer Vision

My research interest is at the interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence and healthcare, aiming to improve the entire medical imaging/radiology workflow with significant impact for clinical use via machine intelligence. My current research mainly focuses on the development of effective and robust machine learning algorithms for medical image computing and analysis, such as MR image reconstruction, medical image segmentation, image registration and motion tracking . 

We are also part of the [Biomedical Image Analysis Group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/).

Opening
======
I am looking for highly motivated PhD students to work on machine learning for medical image computing in 2023, starting at Imperial College London. Prospective students will have a good first degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Automation or other engineering-related disciplines. Please feel free to drop me an email if you're interested.
