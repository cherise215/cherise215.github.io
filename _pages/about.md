Dr Chen (Cherise) Chen is a Lecturer in Computer Vision, at the Department of Computer Science, [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), a core member of [Insigeno Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/insigneo) and [Shef.AI](https://shef-ai.github.io/) community. She also currently holds honorary research fellow positions at both the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. Previously, she was a post-doc at [Oxford BioMedIA](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/#ourresearch) group, University of Oxford, and the Computing Department at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (ICL). She was also a research scientist at [HeartFlow](https://www.heartflow.com/). In 2022, she obtained her Ph.D. from the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, working closely with [Prof. Daniel Rueckert ](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.rueckert)and [Dr. Wenjia Bai](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.bai).

Dr. Chen specializes in the interdisciplinary field of medical image and signal analysis using machine learning, with a focus on enhancing healthcare through advanced AI tools. These tools are designed for high-precision early disease diagnosis, risk prediction, and treatment planning. Her previous work includes the development of data-efficient, robust AI algorithms for medical image segmentation, aimed at improving the adaptability of AI in various unseen scenarios without the need for manual labeling and model retraining. Her doctoral thesis, entitled "Improving the domain generalization and robustness of neural networks for medical imaging," was featured in ComputerVisionNews magazine in 2022. Recently, Dr. Chen has concentrated on developing robust, adaptive, and explainable machine learning strategies for healthcare, particularly in multi-modality learning (e.g., image, signal, text report, knowledge graph analysis).

Research Interest
-----------------

My main research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare with a particular focus on medical image analysis, e.g., medical image segmentation, focusing on building and verifyingrobust, data-efficient, reliablemachine learning algorithms to scale up AI-powered medical image analysis in real-world applications. Below are some topics I have explored:

* Adversarial data augmentation
* Robust machine learning
* Data-efficient learning: self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, semi-supervised learning
* Multi-task and multi-modal learning
* Adaptive machine learning, including unsupervised domain adaptation at training/test time
* Algorithms with fairness, privacy, robustness, and interpretability in mind, including uncertainty-aware training, test time model calibration

I am extremely interested in their applications including:

* cardiac image analysis (segmentation, registration, and shape remodeling) with quality control (e.g. topology preserving, uncertainty measurement), follow-up motion/shape analysis, survival prediction, treatment planning
* prostate image analysis together with pathological image analysis, risk prediction, **treatment planning **
* brain image segmentation and surface reconstruction for clinical applications.

Opening

**We have opening positions for PhD on robust and adaptive AI for healthcare **[**[application portal](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/apply/applying)]**. If you're interested in doing a Ph.D. with me,  please first fillout the Google [form](https://forms.gle/qXHpvGHwnMqNxov78) first and send an email expressing interest to [work.cherise@gmail.com](mailto:work.cherise@gmail.com) including your CV, transcript, and one of your research papers/thesis if applicable. Due to the large amount of emails I receive (50-100 emails per day), I may not be able to respond to each one individually. Please help me catch your email by inserting '[PHD-robustAI]' in the subject title. Please strictly follow the instructions :)

My team is closely collaborating with researchers at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. :) Prospective students will have a good first degree (e.g., top 10%) in Computer Science, Statistics, Software Engineering, Physics, Maths, Medicine,  or other STEM and engineering-related disciplines and more importantly, be passionate about AI for healthcare.
